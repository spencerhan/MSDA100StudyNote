# PowerBI note

## Part 1: Visualising data. 

### <1> Customisation
#### 1.1 Grid font size change the size for an entire visual. 

#### 1.2 matrix has drill through, whereas table just summary

#### 1.3 View -> sync slicers, when deleting a slicer remeber to reset it (use view -> selection to see underlying active slicer). 

#### 1.4 column tool -> sort by a column
#### 1.5 only categorical can be sorted, not continuous. 
#### 1.6 button text for hover over style for a text. 

### <2> Visualisation
#### 2.1 ribbon chart shows the rank of a group in the total.
#### 2.2 waterfall chart shows the cumulative of values.
#### 2.3 scatter plot shows the relationship, comparison between two numbers. 
#### 2.4 pie charts and donut charts, how categories made up to the total. 
#### 2.5 tree map is an alternative.
#### 2.6 funnel chart, sequential data, trend going by series and stages. 
#### 2.7 you cannot change format for a column if it's in a hierarchy, you have to format it when it's not in a hierarchy then added to hierarchy after formatted. 

#### 2.8 arcmap for power bi does not have all country, you can add the data, then zoom to country of interest, then search the country specific map from reference layer list on arcgis online. 

#### 2.9 Gauge charts shows the progress towards a certain target.
#### 2.10 function colouring -> whichever ones come in the latter, takes the higher priority when conditional formatting has overlap figure. 

#### 2.11 KPI charts compare something over time against a target. 
#### 2.12 quick measure may not work with some special cases, such as comma as digit separators instead of dot. 

#### 2.13 reference line can be added via the analytics pane, can't be used in all visualisation such as combined charts. 

#### 2.14 numerical grouping = binning (bucketing)
#### 2.15 key influencer shows the main contributer for something; top segements shows  the main semgents for something.

#### 2.16 tree decomposition shows how a measure breaks down at different levels. high values, low values. 
#### 2.17 PBIDS (power bi desktop source) pointer to a data source. PBIDS is a json object. (just double click to open, instead of adding data within power bi).
#### 2.18 paginate report created by power bi report builder. (used for pixel wise perfect), it's an additional licensing. row groups expand vertically, column group expand horizontally (i.e. row level total).
